%% Author notes:

Credit goes to all of us, wheras i was responsible for the back end, Diego designed an UI, and Aleksandra was responsible for documentation and scenery of the game. I hope that somebody will see value in this simple yet helpful game, as looking at cards with numbers is standard technique. We believe children might be more interested in playing this game. Not only it shakes off the uneasy feeling that is learnt while going to a doctors office as a child, but helps navigate child's mind to be more open for future visits.
